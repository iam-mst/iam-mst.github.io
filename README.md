# IAM Lab Website

Welcome to the Innovative Additive Manufacturing Lab website repository! Here we maintain source code for [http://web.mst.edu/~mstiam/](http://web.mst.edu/~mstiam/).

If you'd like to know how to edit the website, please go [here](http://web.mst.edu/~mstiam/edit).

## How to Build

This website uses a static website generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is automatically built and deployed using a continuous integration tool called [BuddyWorks](https://buddy.works/) whenever the files are updated.

Below is an indicator of the status of compilation and deployment on BuddyWorks.
