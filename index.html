      <h4>Who We Are:</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Additive manufacturing holds great promise for the future as a tool-less,
        light-out manufacturing technology, and offers significant benefit over
        conventional manufacturing processes in producing one-of-a-kind parts or
        small batches, especially for those with geometric and/or material
        complexities. The Innovative Additive Manufacturing (IAM) Laboratory
        conducts research to develop novel additive manufacturing processes and
        also on the optimization and innovative applications of these and other
        additive manufacturing processes.

      <h4>What We Do:</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Recently, we have been developing a novel ceramic additive manufacturing
        process, called <em>Ceramic On-Demand Extrusion (CODE)</em>, and its
        fabrication of 3D parts from ceramics, glasses, and ceramic composites
        (including functionally gradient materials). Our research group are also
        investigating methods to optimize the <em>Selective Laser Melting</em>,
        <em>Selective Laser Sintering</em>, and <em>Fused Deposition Modeling</em>
        processes. Finally we are developing novel applications of the various
        additive manufacturing processes for the aerospace, defense, energy,
        electronics, biomedical and other industries. Information is available from
        the IAM lab website on each of the currently active
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research-projects">research projects</a>.
