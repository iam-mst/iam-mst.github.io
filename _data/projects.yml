- name: Additive Manufacturing by Ceramic On-Demand Extrusion
  shortname: Ceramic On-Demand Extrusion
  desc: |
    This research investigates using the ceramic on-demand extrusion (CODE)
    process to fabricate complex 3D parts made of ceramics and ceramic composites,
    with applications to aerospace, energy, and biomedical industries. CODE is a
    novel freeform extrusion fabrication process recently developed at Missouri
    S&amp;T. This process uses layer-by-layer extrusion of aqueous pastes followed
    by uniform radiation drying between successive layers. The parts that we have
    fabricated using this process include aerospace structural components with
    high-temperature and ultra-high-temperature materials (e.g., alumina, zirconium
    diboride, and partially stabilized zirconia). This process has also been used
    to fabricate smart parts with embedded sensors, e.g., smart lining blocks
    with embedded optical fiber sensors that can used for <em>in situ</em>
    temperature and stress monitoring. Our current research focuses on fabricating
    composite structures made of two or more materials that can be distinct materials
    or graded in compositions continuously as programmed to created parts with
    functionally graded materials. The current research tasks include: (1) design
    of parts with optimal material distribution, (2) development of colloidal
    pastes from ceramic powder (3) simultaneous control of flow rates of multiple
    pastes and homogeneous mixing of pastes, and (4) evaluating the mechanical
    properties of fabricated parts with functionally graded materials.

- name: Additive Manufacturing by Selective Laser Melting (SLM)
  shortname: Selective Laser Melting
  desc: |
    The aim of this project is to perform fundamental research aimed at
    understanding the selective laser melting (SLM) process, which is an additive
    manufacturing technique that bonds successive layers of powder to produce
    metal parts with any complex 3D geometry. The main research objectives are:
    to characterize powder material, relate it to part properties and assess its
    viability for reuse/recycling; to improve part properties through
    optimization of process parameters; to control the microstructure of
    manufactured parts with sensing using an infrared camera; to tune the
    chemistry of input powder for the SLM process. To address these objectives,
    the project consists of the following tasks: (1) powder characterization, (2)
    material property characterization, (3) temperature effects on material
    properties, (4) controlling microstructure and mechanical properties, and (5)
    chemistry specifically for additive manufacturing.

- name: Laser Foil Printing (LFP) for Additive Manufacturing
  shortname: Laser Foil Printing
  desc: |
    The objective of the project is to develop a new additive manufacturing (AM)
    technology, called Laser Foil Printing (LFP), for fabricating three-dimensional
    (3D) metal parts. Instead of using metal powders as in most existing AM
    technologies, the new method uses metal foils as feed stock. The procedure
    consists of two alternating processes: foil welding by a high-power
    continuous-wave laser and foil cutting by a Q-switched ultraviolet laser. The
    foil welding process involves two sub-processes: laser spot welding and laser
    raster-scan welding. The reason for using two lasers is to achieve simultaneously
    the high-speed and high-precision manufacturing. The results on laser
    foil-welding and foil-cutting show that complete and strong welding bonds can
    be achieved with selected parameters, and that clean and no-burr/distortion
    cut of foil can be obtained. Several 3D AISI 1010 steel parts fabricated by
    the proposed AM technology are obtained, and the micro-hardness and tensile
    strength of the as-fabricated parts are both significantly greater than those
    of the original foil. The LFP can also be used for fabricating sensor-embedded
    parts and for outer space manufacturing under low gravity, vacuum and low
    temperature environments.

- name: Low-Cost Rapid Tooling by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
  shortname: Fused Deposition Modeling
  desc: |
    The objective of this research project is to investigate low-cost rapid
    tooling with Ultem (9085 &amp; 1010) using the fused deposition modeling (FDM)
    process, an additive manufacturing technique that built a part layer-by-layer
    by extruding thermoplastic material that is supplied in the filament form.
    The tooling can be used in manufacturing of composites with the autoclave,
    vacuum assisted resin transfer molding and other processes, as well as in
    stamp forming applications. In this project, Ultem specimens are fabricated
    using the FDM process and then their mechanical properties are measured in
    compression, tension, and flexure tests at room and elevated temperatures.
    The test specimens include solid coupons and sparse-build coupons with varying
    build parameters including air gap, wall thickness, and cap thickness, as well
    as different internal lattice structures. Modeling and simulation with finite
    element analysis is used to predict the mechanical properties of sparse-build
    FDM tools and compare the predicted results with data obtained from
    experimental testing. The project is conducted jointly by Missouri S&amp;T
    and Boeing Research &amp; Technology.

- name: 3D Printing for Bone Tissue Engineering
  shortname: Bone Tissue Engineering
  desc: |
    In this research, we first investigated the fabrication of scaffolds with
    engineered porosity from 13-93 bioactive glass using the selective laser
    sintering (SLS) process and an extrusion-based process. The SLS process is a
    powder-bed based additive manufacturing technique that fabricates a scaffold
    layer-by-layer by controlling laser scans to sinter the mixture of ceramic
    and binder particles in a powder bed. Pore geometry in the scaffold is shown
    to play a crucial role as it affects not only the mechanical properties and
    degradation over time as well as the amount of bone regeneration upon
    implantation. In the extrusion-based process, aqueous-based bioactive glass
    paste was deposited layer-by-layer using a micro-sized nozzle. The fabricated
    green scaffolds are then heat treated to remove the binder. Our sintered
    scaffolds demonstrated an average compressive strength of 136 MPa, which is
    the highest reported in additive manufacturing of bioactive glass. To improve
    the toughness of the scaffold, titanium fibers were added to the paste to
    increase the fracture toughness and flexure strength of the scaffold.
    Because a major limitation of synthetic bone repair is insufficient
    vascularization in the interior of the porous implant, our current research
    focuses on 3D bioprinting of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) suspended in the
    hydrogel and polymer-bioactive glass composite. Bioprinting a scaffold with
    these materials would offer a 3D environment for complex and dynamic
    interactions that govern the MSCs behavior <em>in vivo</em>. Bioactive glass
    is added to a mixture of polymer and an organic solvent to make an extrudable
    paste. Porous polymer-glass composite scaffolds are fabricated by extruding
    this paste using a syringe, and MSCs suspended in the hydrogel is deposited
    using another syringe. <em>In vitro</em> assessment indicates the viability
    of the process to print MSCs suspended in Matrigel. Fluorescence images from
    the live-dead assay indicate that cells are alive and actively moving in the
    scaffold.
