# Facilities Data File
# Description
#     This file contains individual records for each facility or equipment.
#     Feel free to use an existing record as a starting point for a new entry.
#     Each individual record is denoted by ONLY ONE dash "-" on the first line.
#     After that, a list of attributes can be seen.
#     The name of the attribute is to the left of the colon; the value is to the
#       right of the colon.
#     Available attributes are as follows:
#         name          The name of the equipment*
#         manufacturer  The name of the manufacturer of the equipment
#         link          Link to the webpage of the equipment (not just the
#                       manufacturer website)
#         desc          A short description on the capabilities and features of
#                       the equipment
#         specs         A list of specifications. Each entry only has a single
#                       "name" attribute
#         photo         Just the name and the extension of the image file for
#                       the equipment (must exist in the /img/facilities/ directory)
#         sample-parts  Just the name and the extension of the image file for
#                       the sample part made by the equipment. Each entry only
#                       has a single "photo" attribute.
#                       (image file must exist in the /img/facilities/ directory)
#      * Required in order for the website to display
#    Additional Notes:
#      - Quotes around the values are optional.
#      - Non-required attributes with blank values can be omitted completely.
#      - For long entries, it is advised to use a block style: in front of the
#           key, add a ">" character, followed by as many indented lines as
#           needed,
#           e.g., - name: >
#                     This is a very very long entry that doesn't fit in a
#                     single line.
