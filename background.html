        <h4>Innovative Additive Manufacturing</h4>
        <p align="justify">
          Due to rapid technology advances, customer demands, and globalization of
          the world's economies, industrial companies must be able to continuously
          introduce new products rapidly at competitive prices. For a company to
          compete successfully in the 21st century, being able to generate
          high-quality products at low costs is not enough. The company must be able
          to master the rapid product realization process, from product definition,
          conceptual design, detailed design, prototyping, to manufacturing. The
          technologies and tools that enable companies to create innovative new
          products and bring them to the market quickly and inexpensively are
          becoming more and more critical.

          The Innovative Additive Manufacturing Laboratory (IAM) at the Missouri
          University of Science and Technology is created to meet the major
          challenges of rapid product realization. The objectives of this lab are:
        </p>
    		<ul>
          <li>
            Generate fundamental knowledge essential to the development of advanced
            virtual and rapid prototyping technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop novel methods, innovative processes, and advanced software tools
            for the next-generation virtual and rapid prototyping practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disseminate the generated fundamental knowledge and the developed
            technologies and tools to students and corporate employees viaon-campus
            and distance education as well as direct technology transfer.
